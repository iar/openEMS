MRI Linear Polarized Birdcage Coil
====================================

Simulate a linear-polarized birdcage coil for MRI at 297 MHz (7 T), tune
the resonance with distributed capacitors, and evaluate B1 field homogeneity.

**This tutorial covers:**

* Birdcage coil geometry with multiple rungs and end rings
* Distributed lumped capacitors for resonance tuning
* B1 field homogeneity assessment across the coil bore

Body Model
----------

This tutorial uses the **Ella** voxel body model from the IT'IS Virtual
Family dataset (``Ella_26y_V2_1mm``). The dataset is free for academic and
non-commercial use but requires registration and a license agreement from the
IT'IS Foundation (https://itis.swiss/virtual-population/).

Once downloaded, the raw files are converted to an openEMS HDF5 DiscMaterial
file by ``Convert_VF_DiscMaterial`` (run once, result is cached).

**Automatic phantom fallback:**

If the VF dataset is not installed, the script falls back automatically to
the bundled ``resources/phantoms/phantom_body_128MHz.h5`` — a 3-layer
cylindrical body phantom (skin / bone / tissue, radius 100 mm) with tissue
properties at 128 MHz from the IT'IS database, shared with the Python
interface. The cylindrical FDTD solver converts each cell-centre position
from cylindrical to Cartesian before the disc-material lookup, so the
Cartesian phantom mesh is sampled correctly. The full B1 and SAR workflow
runs without any changes.
