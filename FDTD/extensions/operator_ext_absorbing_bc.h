/*
 * The localized boundary conditions currently implemented are denoted:
 * - First order Mur BC, single phased velocity
 * - First order Mur BC with super absorption, single phase velocity.
 * These were chosen after experimentation with the various boundary
 * conditions suggested in [1]. The amount of post processing and
 * absorption performance pointed towards the Single PV 1st order Mur.
 * Since this method also requires an extra mesh cell in the doublet grid,
 * the option to use the regular 1st order Mur was left available.
